## TradingView Scripts

This repository simply stores a set of personal TradingView Pine Script studies such as `multi-vwap.pine` and `single-rvwap.pine`. It exists as a convenient place to version and share these scripts; nothing beyond TradingView scripts lives here.

### Included scripts

- `single-rvwap.pine`: Rolling VWAP study.
- `multi-vwap.pine`: Multi-timeframe rolling VWAP study.
- `cold-ribbon.pine`: `Cold Ribbon` trend ribbon built on EMA 12/25 regime logic with Hull-style smoothing and adaptive timeframe responsiveness.

### Credits

`cold-ribbon.pine` was built as an original implementation inspired by:

- Hull Suite by InSilico (Hull-style smoothing concepts)
- Trader XO Macro Trend Scanner by btc_charlie (EMA regime ideas)
